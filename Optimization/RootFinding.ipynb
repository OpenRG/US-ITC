    "# Root Finders in Python\n",
    "### by [Jason DeBacker](https://jasondebacker.com), October 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook illustrates how to do numerical root-finding in Python using the SciPy package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The root-finding problem\n",
    "The general formulation of a root-finder of a system of $N$ non-linear equations can be written as, $\\phi(x|z,\\theta)=0$, where $f(\\cdot)$ is a nonlinear function of variables $x$ and $z$ and parameters $\\theta$.  The solution to this system of equations are values $\\hat{x}$ that satisfy $\\phi(x|z,\\theta)=0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{x} = x: \\quad \\phi(x|z,\\theta) = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example: Minimizing Average Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our problem of minimizing average cost.  Given the total cost function $C(x) = a + bx + cx^2$ where output $x \\geq 0$ and $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive constants.  Average cost is thus given by $AC(x) = ax^{-1} + b + cx$.  Thus the minimization problem here is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} : f(x) \\quad\\text{s.t}\\quad x\\geq 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write this problem as a scalar root-finding problem where we find the $x$ that satisfies the first order necessary condition of minimizing average cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-ax^{-2} + c = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $x$ that solves the FOC is the $x$ that minimizes $AC(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this simple problem, we know the $x$, which minimizing $AC(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x} = \\left(\\frac{a}{c}\\right)^{1/2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's see how we can find this minimum numerically with a root-finding algorithm."

    "\n",
    "Minimization problems can often be reformulated as root-finding problems (and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this single dimensional problem, the root finder is generally faster.  But this might not generalize to higher dimensional problems.  However, the root-finder is a useful tool to have in your toolbox for solving economic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note that a potential limitation of the root-finding algorithms in `scipy.optimize.root` are that they do not accept bounds if the function is multi-dimensional -- so bounded root-finding methods need to be defined in a custom fashion (e.g., but recasting it as a minimization problem)."

    "# Simulated Method of Moments\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on McFadden (*Econometrica*, 1989), the Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) is a method to estimate the parameters of a model by matching the moments of the data with the moments of the model. The moments are calculated by simulating the model many times and averaging the results. The method is particularly useful when the model is too complex to be solved analytically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SMM estimator, $\\hat{\\theta}_{S,T}(W)$, is define as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\theta}_{S,T}(W)= argmin_{\\theta} \\left[ \\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\mu(x_t) - \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\mu(x(u^s_t, \\theta)) \\right) \\right]^{'} W_T^{-1} \\left[ \\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\left(\\mu(x_t) - \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^{S} \\mu(x(u^s_t, \\theta)) \\right) \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $x_t$ are a sequence of $T$ observations of the data\n",
    "* $\\mu(\\cdot)$ is a function of the data\n",
    "* $x(u^s_t, \\theta)$ is the model simulated data for the $s$-th simulation\n",

    "## SMM with the McCall model\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use SMM to estimate two parameters of our job search model. Recall that the McCall model had four parameters:\n",
    "1. $\\theta$, the replacement rate for unemployment benefits\n",
    "2. $\\beta$, the discount factor\n",
    "3. $\\mu$, the wage offer distribution mean\n",
    "4. $\\sigma$, the wage offer distribution standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll assume that $\\beta=0.99$ and we'll consider the problem of college graduates, for whom the replacement rate is $\\theta=0.0$. We'll estimate the mean and standard deviation of the wage offer distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "For data, we'll use the following moments: the fraction of graduates who are employed after 90 days and the mean wage of those who are employed.  For [graduates from my business school who major in economics, finance, and marketing the numbers are](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/talent_recruiting/office_of_career_management/company_recruiter_resources/employment_statistics/index.php):\n",

    "|Real Estate| 78% | $70,867 |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use an identify matrix as the weight matrix.  We'll need to estimate $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ separately for each major. As such, we'll use [Dask](https://www.dask.org) to parallelize the estimation process.\n"
